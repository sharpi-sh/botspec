# botspec
BotSpec is a file, similar to robots.txt, located in the root directory of a domain. It serves as a signpost for assistant AI bots, providing structured information about available actions, API endpoints, and documentation links. This allows bots to efficiently discover and access resources on a server.

To contribute make changes to the template files in this directory. Changes merged to master will be deployed to botspec.org
